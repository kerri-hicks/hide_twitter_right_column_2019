# Hide Twitter Right Column

A Chrome extension that hides the right column on the Twitter website.

I find the right-side column distracting, so I made this little extension that hides the right column. It'll work until Twitter changes its HTML structure. Note: As of now, this also hides the search bar. I'll change that at some point.

No license needed, public domain.

Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, turn on Developer Mode (toggle switch in the top right corner, as of August 2019), choose one of the installation methods below:

1) If you want to load it without packing it, use the "Load Unpacked" button, and load the "retwitter" directory.

2) If you want to create your own .crx file, choose the "Pack Extension" button and load the "retwitter" directory. Then drag the .crx file to the extensions browser window.

 You're done, the extension will show up in Chrome as a white H in a grey box.
 It seems to work in Vivaldi, too, if you use the "Load Unpacked" method, but nothing shows up in the browser Extensions bar.
