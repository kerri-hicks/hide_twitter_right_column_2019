# Hide Twitter Right Column

A Chrome extension that hides the right column on the Twitter website.

I find the right-side column distracting, so I made this little extension that hides the right column. It'll work until Twitter changes its HTML structure.

No license needed, public domain.

Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, turn on Developer Mode (toggle switch in the top right corner, as of August 2019), and drag the .crx (packed extension) file to the browser window. You're done, the extension will show up in Chrome as a white H in a grey box.

If you want to compile it yourself (or if you want to edit the CSS with other rules), use the "Load Unpacked" button, and load the "retwitter" directory.

If you want to create your own .crx file, choose the "Pack Extension" button and load the retwitter directory.
